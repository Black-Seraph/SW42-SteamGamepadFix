# Button GUI fix
This tool + texture pack replaces the keyboard-themed button overlays inside the game with an Xbox360 controller themed one.

It was not made by me, but I've found it to be a must-have when used in combination with my steamy button remapper library fix.

# How to use it?
Place the files from the binary subdirectory into your game installation's Data folder and execute patch.dat as administrator to swap the textures out.

That's it.
